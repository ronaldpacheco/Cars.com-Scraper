# Cars.com-Scraper
This scraper will gather carName, model, make, prices, location, mileage, seller (private or dealer), year &amp; trim. It will also create a database with all the info. 

Make sure to change PATH to match the location of your chromedriver, as well as the URLs you want to scrape. 

You also might need to change the xpaths if you want to scraper something other than what is being gathered as is.
